The KM from literature for the cellulolysis reaction was calculated by converting from reported mg/ml. But I accidentally converted into millimoles, not millimolar (that is, millimoles per ml).

There are now two pairs of conversion scripts: convertMmolarToMgPerMl and convertMmolesToMgPerMl. Consider deleting the latter altogether? It might be dangerous.
