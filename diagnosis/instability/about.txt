The included files reveal some sort of numerical instability in COMETS.

When the timestep for this layout is set to exactly 10, a large biomass yield is predicted.
When the timestep is set to anything else, in this case 10.0001, the system predicts barely any growth.

The layout and log files for the former have the "_10" suffix, and the latter have the "_10p0001" suffix.
